In this project i checked in the lessons i'll give in a workshop 2018 (= 5 lessons a 2 hours).
For every lesson you will find a folder, where i checked in a description, code and worksheets.

The guidline of the workshop is 'acquire competence in dealing with computers'. The students have their own laptop-Computers. The students should understand, that they can use a computer to realize any idea. That is the impact of learning a programming-language: Having competence in that, you can use it to solve problems, realize an idea and much more. The workshop is built up to do anything with the computer for more then 50 procent along the whole workshop.
