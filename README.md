# SonicPi
In this project i checked in the lessons i'll give in a workshop 2018 (= 5 lessons a 2 hours).
For every lesson you will find a folder, where i checked in a description, code and worksheets.

Experiences i will post on https://in-thread.sonic-pi.net/c/educators

The guideline of the workshop is 'acquire competence in dealing with computers'. The students (between 14 and 18) have their own laptop-Computers. The students should understand, that they can use a computer to realize any idea. SonicPi is an excellent tool to realize ideas in connection with music. First you have an idea, then you want to realize it. That is a good way to learn a programming-language.
