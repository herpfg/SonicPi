* create your own Guitar-Samples
The students go to a special room, where we've prepared the equipement to record any Gutar-Chords. We will record Am,Dm,Fmaj7 and G.
Both: upstroke and downStroke

* Call the samples in Sonic Pi
Everyone should become the samples on the Computer and should build up a List of samples and play them

* Build up a guitar-loop
Similar to the piano_loop you should bind the Guitar-Samples in a loop
