* Asking for any questions in lesson 1

Everyone should run the 6-bar code in his buffer

* Explain live_loop

Surround the 6 bars with a live_loop: explain the syntax (with a name you can choose for example your own name).
Press run and you hear: it repeats and repeats and repeats...until you press stop. Explain that the main thing is: 
First it runs from top to down, then it makes a gap to the first line again and it runs again from top to down. This is
a change of the rule, that the program should go from top to down and should finish as we learned last lesson. The flow of 
the program is now changed. Therefore a live_loop may be seen as a control-structur. We will later learn more other 
structurs that changes the standard-flow the program, all these structures would basically do the same: there is anywhere a 
controled gap.
Tell the students a story: In professional programming a loop like a live_loop, that will never end, is a horror: Imagine a 
program, that is running to make the monthly salary payments on the accounts of your employees. You start the program to do so.
You notice after one hour: the program is still running...what do you think??? Uaah...
